              The Pawtucket government website is a good example of website that, while responsive, has several
              usability, learnability, memorability, and accessibility issues. Since it is a government website and
              people just want to get information quickly, it wasn't able to serve its purpose effectively.

                  <!-- <p>The problem the microwave is trying to solve is that of heating food or beverages. It has several
                    components, which function as follows.</p> -->

                  <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-3">
                    <li>The "Follow us on ..." social media banner has no links to any social media, which are also not
                      present anywhere else on the page.</li>
                    <li>The carousel has no signs to indicate that it is a carousel (like arrows or the selector at the
                      bottom). It initally just appears as an image and then fades in and out, requiring to be swiped to
                      change what's displayed (an action also not indicated).</li>
                    <li>Different fonts are used throughout the website with no consistent design language for links and
                      other key elements.</li>
                    <li>The "Connect With Us" logo is not clearly indicated as something that must be pressed, and
                      without any caption or obviously identifiable symbol, the user is required to make a greater
                      effort to read the text and understand what it is for.</li>
                    <li>The link to view more news is located a long way above the actual news section, which is
                      confusing.</li>
                    <li>There are no headings used anywhere, which inhibits the effort to produce a clear visual
                      hierarchy.</li>
                    <li>Font sizes do not adjust on resizing, making it difficult to read on smaller screens.</li>
                    <li>Efficiency is a problem:
                      <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-3">
                        <li>Something simple and commonly used like "Report a problem" requires scrolling all the way to
                          the bottom of the page to do.</li>
                        <li>Other frequent actions (like "Email Log In") are also present at the bottom, increasing the
                          time required to do these actions.</li>
                        <li>Important information seems to be displayed on the carousel, which we've seen is confusing
                          to figure out how to use.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                  <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-3">
                    <li>Some items may take a little time to get used to, like the carousel at the beginning</li>
                    <li>Some commonly used items (like "Report a Problem") may not be in a location people expect due to
                      their popularity, but for specific tasks, it should be easy to remember where they are.</li>
                    <li>Finding related tasks may be tricky - due to the lack of clear hierarchy, there may be some
                      issues with navigation or figuring out where things are.</li>

                    <li>Some things (though inefficient) are easy to remember: e.g. it would be easy to remember to
                      scroll to the bottom each time you needed to report a problem..</li>
                    <li>Other things are harder to remember: e.g. a user may not remember that they need to scroll
                      through the carousel to find Covid (or other) information</li>
                    <li>Some things may be memorable but may move around on the page: e.g. the new City Hall business
                      hours are on the carousel for now, but may not always be.</li>

                <h3 class="h3">Accessibility</h3>
                <div class="mb-3">
                  <!-- <p>The problem the microwave is trying to solve is that of heating food or beverages. It has several
                    components, which function as follows.</p> -->

                  <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-3">
                    <li>The most common accessibility issue is contrast: WebAIM WAVE detected 46 "Very low contrast
                      errors". This is because the website often pairs light font colours (like a light orangish-red)
                      with light background colours (like light grey), making it difficult to read parts of the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are also issues with empty headers or empty links. While there are invisible and may not
                      impact an able user, this might be confusing for a user who requires a screen reader to navigate
                      websites.</li>
                    <li>Some of the empty links reduce usability for everyone: empty links like Twitter and Facebook
                      should be visible</li>
                    <li>There are many redundant link alerts where adjacent links go to the same URL. This may cause
                      some minor confusion for able users and may be much worse for users requiring screen readers,
                      which will repeat the same link many times.</li>

                  <li>While the frequency of usage varies between users, the most common reason that people use the
                    microwave is to reheat food or beverage, and sometimes to heat up frozen food.</li>
                  <li>There are several buttons on the microwave which users don't know what they do, such as
                    <i>Inverter Turbo Defrost</i> or <i>More/Less</i>. The preset options don't usually work for a
                    user's requirements.
                  </li>
                  <li>The most important component of the user's microwave usage experience is the ability to easily and
                    quickly set a time and run the microwave. The sheer number of buttons and the confusing preset
                    options are the most frustrating components of the microwave.</li>
                  <li>When trying to heat something they didn't know could go in a microwave, users would usually look
                    up whether it could be heated or not. In some cases, if it was being heated for a short amount of
                    time, they would heat it and watch the microwave carefully. Having concise guidelines on the
                    microwave would help reduce the time required for this step.</li>
